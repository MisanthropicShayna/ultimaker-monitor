# Ultimaker Monitor
This tool uses the Ultimaker 3's WebAPI to wirelessly poll information about the 3D printer's state, such as temperature, memory usage, print status, print history, system log, etc. It also allows for some basic control over the 3D printer's current printjob, as well as the ability to upload printjobs in GCode format.
